If you are really scared about it being a virus, download the application and [compile it yourself](#Ô∏è-building-from-source-on-windows). Look through the source code.

## **üöÄ Installation**

Download the compiled executable from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/104) or over on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/EternalWraith/PalEdit/releases).

## **‚ö†Ô∏è A word of warning**

When in the app, simply load a _deserialized_ save file using the file menu. Wait **patiently** for it to load the `*.json` and gather the data.
You can then replace the traits of your Pals with ones that you want.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is advised that you backup ALL save files before using the tool; it will eventually do this on it's own but doesn't yet.
> For more information on how to do this, see the [**üì¶ Backing up your save**](#-backing-up-your-save) section.

It is recommended to save your edited pals as a `*.pson` file for easier access. You can choose to save as a `*.pson` file. When you want to inject the changes into your save, simply save over your `Level.sav.json` and the program will splice it in at the correct location. Then Serialize the save again using 'palworld-save-tools' and put the resulting `Level.sav` into your save folder where the original one was. Load up PalWorld and enjoy.

## **üïπÔ∏è Usage**

1. Convert your save to a `*.sav.json` using the Convert menu at the top.
2. Load the `*.sav.json` file using the File menu.
3. Edit your Pals as desired.
4. Save the changes to the same `*.sav.json` file.
5. Convert it back to a `*.sav` using the Convert menu again.

## **üíæ Saving Edited Pals**

1. Save your edited pals as a `*.pson` file for easier access.
2. Choose to save as a `*.pson` file.
3. To inject the changes into your save, save over your `Level.sav.json`.
4. The program will splice it in at the correct location.
5. Serialize the save again using the Convert menu.
6. Put the resulting `Level.sav` into your save folder where the original one was.
7. Load up PalWorld and enjoy.

## **üì¶ Backing up your save**

It is advised that you backup ALL save files before using the tool. Although the tool will eventually do this on its own, it doesn't yet.

On Windows, the saves can be found in the following locations:

- `%appdata%/Local/Pal/Save/Savegames`
- `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Pal\Saved\SaveGames`

Replace `<username>` with your Windows username.

If you‚Äôve installed Palworld via Steam, you can also access your save files by following these steps:

1. Open your Steam library.
2. Right-click on Palworld, then select Manage > Browse local files.
3. This will open the folder where Palworld‚Äôs installed files are stored, named Pal.
4. From here, go to Saved > SaveGames to access your save files for the game.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Building from source (on Windows)**

1. Install Python, at least version 3.10 (for the CI/CD pipeline we are using Python 3.12.1). You can get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Don't forget to check the box to add Python to your PATH.
2. Open a PowerShell window in the root of the project.
3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```powershell
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

    ```powershell
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

    > If you get an error about running scripts, you may need to run the following command first:
    >
    > ```powershell
    > Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    > ```

5. Install the required packages:

    ```powershell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Build the binary file. Once done, it will be located in the `dist` folder:

    ```powershell
    pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "resources/MossandaIcon.ico" --hidden-import=PIL "PalEdit.py"
    ```

    > If you get any error about virus, check the top of this README file. Also this issue comment with some further explanation may interest you: [Issue #41](https://github.com/EternalWraith/PalEdit/issues/41#issuecomment-1914567848)

7. Copy the `resources` folder into the `dist` folder. This is required to display the images inside PalEdit:

    ```powershell
    cp -r resources dist
    ```

8. Run your newly built binary file and enjoy.

> **Alternatively, to run PalEdit without compiling it, follow steps 1 to 5 and then run the following command:**
>
>    ```powershell
>    python PalEdit.py
>    ```
